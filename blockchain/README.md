Each repository needs to be secured separately.  Thus, every
repository can be tracked in it's own, private chain.  There
is no present need to have these blockchains to be public.

Initial implementation may be as simple as signing the
new transaction log entry and including the has of the
previous version that is currently resent in the local
database.
