A single sign on solution is needed.  Repository access will
be controlled and uses should be able to join repositories
based on some credentials.  Ideally this would be something
that is convenient to users and is recoverable.

A good start may be to tie in with Open ID providers like
Google and Facebook.  For the bulk of the users this will
probably work best.
