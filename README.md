# Airbridge

FUTURE WORK
## Why the name 

Airport: "A jet bridge (also termed jetway, jetwalk, airgate, gangway, aerobridge/airbridge,
skybridge, finger, airtube, expedited suspended passenger entry system (E-SPES), or its 
official industry name passenger boarding bridge (PBB)) is an enclosed, movable connector
which most commonly extends from an airport terminal gate to an airplane,"

Logistics: "An airbridge is the route and means of delivering material from one place to 
another by an airlift."

AIRbridge bridges the gap between the core AIRport technology and its uses.

## Description

[AIRport](https://github.com/beyond-decentralized/AIRport) has everything needed
to work on a developer laptop, and for simple applications.  There are a number
of additional concerns that are needed for AIRport to work in production.  Since
AIRport is already very large and complex these are pulled out into the AIRbridge
project.
